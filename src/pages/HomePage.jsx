        Two friends decided to go on a mountain trip. As they ascended higher and higher, they encountered unexpected difficulties and challenging weather conditions. However, they kept moving forward, supporting each other through thick and thin.

At one point, one of the friends stumbled and fell, injuring his leg and unable to move. The other friend could have continued the journey alone, but instead, he chose to stay and help his friend. He arranged a shelter, kept him warm, and they spent the night together in the cold mountains.

By morning, when the weather had improved, they were able to resume their journey. Finally, they reached the mountain peak, where they witnessed a breathtaking view.

The moral of the story: True friends always support each other in challenging times. Having a loyal friend is more important than reaching the summit alone.
